# 1. Introduction
This repository contains the analysis pipeline and results for studying the evolutionary history of the STT3B gene family. It includes all commands, scripts, and output files necessary to replicate the study, along with detailed documentation. The primary focus of this analysis is to explore the inheritance and conservation of STT3B gene copies across various vertebrate lineages, using multiple computational tools and methods such as BLASTP, sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and reconciliation analysis. By following the steps and information provided, users can reproduce the studyâ€™s findings and gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics of the STT3B gene family.

Before each lab clone that labs repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/Bio312/lab(insert lab)-$MYGIT
```

Next move to this new repository 

```
cd lab(insert lab)-$MYGIT
```
This is the same first step for all labs 3-8

At anytime to check what directory you are in use the pwd command 

```
pwd
```
# 2. BLAST

## Lab03:  Finding homologs with BLAST KEY

## Create the BLAST database 

First go to the lab 3 directory 

```
cd ~/lab03-$MYGIT
```
Next in order to uncompress the proteomes. Run the following command:

```
gunzip proteomes/*.gz
```
In order to put all the protein sequences into a single file use the cat command

```
cat  proteomes/*.faa > allprotein.fas
```
Make the BLAST database using this command: 

```
makeblastdb -in allprotein.fas -dbtype prot
```
To organize the BLAST searches, we will first create a directory for the STT3B search and navigate into it

We first created a folder for the STT3B BLAST search using mkdir command:

```
mkdir ~/lab03-$MYGIT/STT3B
```
Check you are in the right directory

## Download the query protein

```
ncbi-acc-download -F fasta -m protein "NP_849193.1"
```
## Perform the BLAST search 

```
blastp -db ../allprotein.fas -query NP_849193.1.fa -outfmt 0 -max_hsps 1 -out STT3B.blastp.typical.out
```
## Perform a BLAST search, and request tabular output

We will create an easier to analyse output. 
This command will allow us to better interpret our BLAST search 

```
blastp -db ../allprotein.fas -query NP_849193.1.fa  -outfmt "6 sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen evalue bitscore pident stitle"  -max_hsps 1 -out STT3B.blastp.detail.out
```
Filtering the BLAST output for high scoring homologs 

We only want high scoring matches so we used a e-value of 1e-30 for our gene STT3B

```
awk '{if ($6< 1e-30)print $1 }' Stt3B.blastp.detail.out > STT3B.blastp.detail.filtered.out
```
In order to actually count the usedul homologs in the BLAST we used this command 

```
grep -o -E "^[A-Z]\.[a-z]+" STT3B.blastp.detail.filtered.out  | sort | uniq -c
```
The output for the above command should give you a table of 11 species and the number of paralogs found in each species. 

# 3. Alignment 
## Lab04: Gene family sequence alignment

Clone lab 04 and use the cd command to move into this directory 

Make sure the VS code extention used to visualize pdf's is downloaded 

## Alighn STT3B gene family members 

create a folder for the STT3B gene family in lab 04 using this command 

```
mkdir ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B
```
go into this directory using the cd command 

```
cd ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B
```
Obtain the sequence that were in the BLAST output file from lab03 using this code

```
seqkit grep --pattern-file ~/lab03-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.blastp.detail.filtered.out ~/lab03-$MYGIT/allprotein.fas | seqkit grep -v -p "carpio" > ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.fas
```
## Perform a global multiple sequence alignment in muscle:

Use the following command to make a multiple sequence allighnment using muscle:

```
muscle -align ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.fas -output ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas
```
Now we are going to view this allighnment then convert it to a pdf so it is easier to analyze

The following is the command used to view the allighnment: 

```
alv -kli  ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas | less -RS
```
Use the majority option for easier viewing 

```
alv -kli --majority ~/lab04-$MYGIT/globins/globins.homologs.al.fas | less -RS
```

This command shows the alignment file with a majority consensus sequence, highlighting the most common residues at each position. The output is formatted for easy viewing and scrolling in the terminal.

Next we will run an R-script code for printing the allighnment:

```
 Rscript --vanilla ~/lab04-$MYGIT/plotMSA.R  ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas
```

## Get information about this allighnment 

First we will caluclate the width of this allighnment using this command: 

```
alignbuddy  -al  ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas
```
Now we will calculate the allghnment removing any of the columns that have gaps in them:

```
alignbuddy -trm all  ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas | alignbuddy  -al
```
Next we will caluclate the length of the allighnment after removing completly conserved positions:

```
alignbuddy -dinv 'ambig' ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas | alignbuddy  -al
```
## Caluclate average percent identity 
First we are gonna calulate the average percent identity using t-coffee: 

```
t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas -output sim
```
Here is how to calculate the percent identity using alighnbuddy: 

```
 alignbuddy -pi ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas | awk ' (NR>2)  { for (i=2;i<=NF  ;i++){ sum+=$i;num++} }
     END{ print(100*sum/num) } '
```
# 4. IQ-Tree
## Lab 5: Gene Family Phylogeny using IQ-TREE
### Constructing a Phylogenetic Tree for STT3B Homologs 

Use the mkdir command to create a directory in lab 05 for STT3B go to that new directory using the cd command

The commands for lab05 work off the alighnment we created in lab 04 

This command standardizes labels and removes duplicate sequences from the STT3B alignment, saving the cleaned file to your lab05 directory:

```
sed 's/ /_/g'  ~/lab04-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.fas | seqkit grep -v -r -p "dupelabel" >  ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.fas
```
This command processes the STT3B homologs file by first replacing any spaces with underscores in the sequence labels and then removing any sequences with the tag "dupelabel". The cleaned output is saved in your lab05 directory as STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.

The following command runs IQ-TREE to estimate the maximum likelihood tree for the STT3B alignment, including bootstrap support:

```
iqtree -s ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.fas -bb 1000 -nt 2
```
The input file is specified with -s. IQ-TREE determines the best substitution model, builds the tree, and estimates branch lengths. The -bb 1000 flag performs 1,000 bootstrap replicates for branch support, while -nt 2 uses 2 CPU threads to speed up the process.

## The Unrooted Tree

These commands display the phylogenetic tree from the STT3B alignment, first using a basic text graphic and then with a cleaner, unrooted graphical representation:

```
# Display the STT3B phylogenetic tree as an ASCII (text-based) graphic using Newick formatted tree file
nw_display ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.treefile

# Use R script to generate an unrooted graphical version of the STT3B phylogenetic tree
# --vanilla: Runs R without loading or saving the workspace (clean session)
# Input: Newick formatted tree file (STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.treefile)
# Output: PDF file of the tree (STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.treefile.pdf)
# 0.4: Sets the text label size
# 15: Limits label length to fit the visualization
Rscript --vanilla ~/lab05-$MYGIT/plotUnrooted.R ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.treefile ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.treefile.pdf 0.4 15
```
The first command shows a quick text-based tree with nw_display, but it may look rooted incorrectly. The second command uses an R script to create a clearer, unrooted graphical tree, adjusting label size and length for readability, and saves it as a PDF.

## Root the optimal phylogeny

### These commands root the phylogenetic tree using the midpoint method, display it graphically, and then provide an alternative cladogram view for easier interpretation.

```
# Midpoint rooting the tree
gotree reroot midpoint -i ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.fas.treefile -o ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile

# Display the rooted tree in a basic text format
nw_order -c n ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile | nw_display -

# Create a graphical SVG image of the rooted tree
nw_order -c n ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile | nw_display -w 1000 -b 'opacity:0' -s > ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile.svg

# Convert the SVG image to a PDF
convert ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile.svg ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile.pdf

# Create a cladogram view of the tree
nw_order -c n ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.mid.treefile | nw_topology - | nw_display -s -w 1000 > ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.midCl.treefile.svg

# Convert the cladogram SVG to a PDF
convert ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.midCl.treefile.svg ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologsf.al.midCl.treefile.pdf
```
  The first command roots the tree at the midpoint of the longest branch using gotree, producing a more meaningful view of divergence events. The rooted tree is initially displayed in text format using nw_display, but this is replaced with a cleaner SVG graphic, which is then converted to a PDF for easier viewing. The cladogram version of the tree, generated by nw_topology, shows all branches with equal lengths, making it simpler to see the relationships between clades without being influenced by branch lengths. The output files (SVG and PDF) are ready for analysis and comparison.

  For the STT3B gene family, we first visualized the tree and rooted it using midpoint rooting, estimating the oldest divergence based on the longest branch. Then, we examined both a phylogram (branch lengths show substitution rates) and a cladogram (all branches are equal), which made the relationships clearer. Next, we refined the tree by rooting it with an outgroup, using a known distant relative for better accuracy. Finally, we checked bootstrap support values, with anything above 80% indicating strong confidence in the branching pattern. This approach helps provide a clear and reliable view of the evolutionary history of the STT3B gene family.

# 5. Reconciling
## Lab 6. Reconciling a Gene and Species Tree

The commands set up a Python 2.7 environment with ETE3 for phylogenetic analysis:

```
mamba create -n my_python27_env python=2.7
conda activate my_python27_env
mamba install -y ete3
```
The first command creates a new environment named my_python27_env with Python 2.7 using Mamba, a faster alternative to Conda. Then, we activate this environment with conda activate. Finally, ETE3, a toolkit for tree analysis and visualization, is installed. This setup only needs to be done once and prepares the environment for future phylogenetic work.

## Preparation and Setup for STT3B Gene Family Reconciliation

In this lab, we are setting up the analysis for the STT3B gene family by copying over the midpoint-rooted gene tree from Lab 5 and organizing our files in the Lab 6 directory. This step ensures we are using the correct gene tree for subsequent reconciliation and analysis tasks.

The following code consolidates the entire process, including directory creation, file copying, pruning (if needed), and visualization:

```
# Step 1: Create a new directory for the STT3B gene family in Lab 6
mkdir ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B

# Step 2: Copy the midpoint-rooted gene tree from Lab 5 to the new Lab 6 directory
cp ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile

# Step 3: Verify that the gene tree file has been copied correctly
ls ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile

# Step 4: (Optional) Prune unwanted sequences from the gene tree
gotree prune -i ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile \
-o ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile \
<sequence1> <sequence2> <sequence3>

# Step 5: Display the pruned gene tree for verification (if pruning was performed)
nw_display ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile
```
This setup process for the STT3B gene family involves creating a new directory in the Lab 6 folder and copying the midpoint-rooted gene tree from Lab 5 to maintain consistency in our analysis. After copying, we verify that the gene tree file was transferred correctly. If necessary, we prune unwanted sequences using the gotree prune command to focus on the ingroup sequences of interest. Finally, we use nw_display to visualize the pruned tree, confirming that the structure is correct before proceeding with reconciliation. This streamlined preparation ensures that our analysis is based on a clean and accurate gene tree, ready for evolutionary investigation. 

## Reconcile the gene and species tree using Notung

In this section, we perform reconciliation of the STT3B gene tree using Notung. This analysis allows us to compare the gene tree with the species tree, helping us detect key evolutionary events such as duplications and losses. Below is the full workflow, including all necessary commands.

```
# Step 1: Create a directory for STT3B in the Lab 6 folder
mkdir ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B

# Step 2: Copy the midpoint-rooted gene tree from Lab 5 to Lab 6
cp ~/lab05-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile

# Step 3: Verify the copied file
ls ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile

# Step 4: (Optional) Prune unwanted sequences from the gene tree
gotree prune -i ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.al.mid.treefile \
-o ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile \
<sequence1> <sequence2> <sequence3>

# Step 5: Display the pruned gene tree (if pruning was performed)
nw_display ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile

# Step 6: Perform reconciliation using Notung
java -jar ~/tools/Notung-3.0_24-beta/Notung-3.0_24-beta.jar \
-s ~/lab05-$MYGIT/species.tre \
-g ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile \
--reconcile --speciestag prefix --savepng --events \
--outputdir ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/

# Step 7: Examine the reconciliation results for duplications and losses
less ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.events.txt

# Step 8: Display internal node names assigned by Notung (if needed)
grep NOTUNG-SPECIES-TREE ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.ntg | \
sed -e "s/^\[&&NOTUNG-SPECIES-TREE//" -e "s/\]/;/" | nw_display -

# Step 9: Generate RecPhyloXML object for detailed visualization
python2.7 ~/tools/recPhyloXML/python/NOTUNGtoRecPhyloXML.py \
-g ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.ntg \
--include.species

# Step 10: Create a reconciliation graphic using thirdkind
thirdkind -Iie -D 40 -f ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.ntg.xml \
-o ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.svg

# Step 11: Convert the SVG file to a PDF for easy viewing
convert -density 150 ~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.svg \
~/lab06-$MYGIT/STT3B/STT3B.homologs.pruned.treefile.rec.pdf
```
This workflow involves setting up the analysis for the STT3B gene family by creating a new directory, copying over the midpoint-rooted gene tree from Lab 5, and optionally pruning any unwanted sequences. We then perform reconciliation using Notung, comparing the gene tree against the species tree to identify evolutionary events such as duplications and losses. The process also includes verifying the results and checking internal node names. Finally, we generate a RecPhyloXML object and create a detailed visualization using thirdkind, followed by converting the graphic to PDF format for easy viewing. This streamlined approach provides a clear and thorough analysis of the STT3B gene family, allowing us to understand its evolutionary changes across different species.
