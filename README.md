### Introduction
This repository contains the analysis pipeline and results for studying the evolutionary history of the STT3B gene family. It includes all commands, scripts, and output files necessary to replicate the study, along with detailed documentation. The primary focus of this analysis is to explore the inheritance and conservation of STT3B gene copies across various vertebrate lineages, using multiple computational tools and methods such as BLASTP, sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and reconciliation analysis. By following the steps and information provided, users can reproduce the studyâ€™s findings and gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics of the STT3B gene family.

Before each lab we would clone that labs repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/Bio312/lab(insert lab)-$MYGIT
```

Next we would need to move to this new repository 

    cd lab03-$MYGIT


###Lab03 Finding homologs with BLAST KEY
We will create a folder using mkdir for the STT3B BLAST search
